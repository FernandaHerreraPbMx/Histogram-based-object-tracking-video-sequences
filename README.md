# Histogram-based-object-tracking-video-sequences

The goal of this programming task is to implement and evaluate multiple histogram based trackers. In total, three trackers will be implemented: a color based histogram tracker, a gradient based histogram tracker and a last one implemented by combining the two firstly mentioned. The performance and accuracy of the different developed trackers were tested over different sequences obtained from the Vot challenge database according to Intersection Over Union criterion and processing time.
